# Compiling


Note that compiler warnings might pop up which can be safely ignored and will most likely be fixed in 
one of the future releases.

## Windows / Linux


We do provide binaries for Windows / Linux systems. You can download them for each release after Koivisto 3.0 [here](https://github.com/Luecx/Koivisto/releases). 
Note that we **strongly recommend** that you build the binaries yourself for best performance.
Assuming build tools have been installed, one can type:

```
git clone https://github.com/Luecx/Koivisto.git
cd Koivisto/

mkdir bin/ 
cd src_files
make native
```

Besides compiling a native version which should be best in terms of performance, one can also compile static executables using:
```
mkdir bin/ 
cd src_files
make release
```

#### MacOS

We do not provide binaries for MacOS yet.
